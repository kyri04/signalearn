Signalearn is a Python library that abstracts the repetitive parts of machine learning workflows for sequential datasets like signals.

Signalearn is backend-agnostic: any component following the standard scikit-learn API (`fit`, `transform`, `predict`, etc.) can be used. This includes estimators, transformers, scalers, and resamplers from libraries such as `sklearn`, `cuml`, `imblearn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, etc.
